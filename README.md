# redux-optimistic-ui-addons

Some small utilities for [redux-optimistic-ui](https://github.com/mattkrick/redux-optimistic-ui). Especially useful if you use [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/). 

Should be compatible with other async redux-middlewares, as it's just middleware and some some utility-functions for optimistic-actions.
